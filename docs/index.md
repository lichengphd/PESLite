# PESLite

PESLite is an open-source, lightweight, multirate, and extensible power electronics simulator in
Python. It is designed for time-domain studies of power-electronic converters and converter-based
systems, combining switching and averaged models, digital control timing, event-driven operation
and flexible numerical integration across multiple time scales.

> This documentation describes the current development version on the `main` branch. For released
> versions and changes, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lonaparte/PESLite/releases) and
> the [changelog](https://github.com/lonaparte/PESLite/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

PESLite supports:

- converter networks described by readable YAML simulation files;
- switching, PWM-period-averaged and ideal averaged bridge models;
- grid-following and grid-forming control;
- fixed-step, adaptive and multirate integration;
- ADC/PWM timing, digital control, protection and energy accounting;
- events and continuation from saved states;
- export as a standalone C++17 simulator.

The power circuit uses SI units. Controller quantities ending in `_pu` use each converter's own
per-unit base.

## Installation

```bash
pip install peslite
```

PESLite requires Python 3.10 or newer.

## Quick start

Run a bundled example:

```bash
peslite gfl-example
```

The results are streamed to `output/gfl-example/`. A simulation file can be run in the same way:

```bash
peslite case.pes
```

See [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md) to create a case and inspect its results.
