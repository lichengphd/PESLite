"""The components of a converter system: the power circuit and the converter's hardware.

The power circuit (:mod:`.network`, including registered ``elements``, and :mod:`.converter`) is
continuous-time, in SI, connected through :class:`peslite.solver.model.Model`. Sampled bridge
models use the ADC (:mod:`.adc`) and own their PWM timing/register implementation from
:mod:`.pwm`; the ideal averaging bridge connects directly to continuous controller equations.
