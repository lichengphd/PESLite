"""The solver: the port-Hamiltonian model kernel, the integrators and the run of a simulation.

``model``: subsystems connected into one model, and named states; ``energy``: their energy
declarations and accounting; ``integrators`` and ``multirate``: the solvers; ``splitbound``: the error
of a multirate split; ``simulation``: the run of an assembled system, what it produces, and the
command line.
